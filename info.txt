list (category):
    type: array
        properties: name of list, to-do/tasks belonging to list
    categories:
        custom, default, work? shopping? holiday? overdue?
    default list:
        displays all categories/to-dos, displays by default when site is opened

each individual todo:
    type: object, factory, constructor, class
    properties: title, description, due date (rag rated?), priority, category, (notes, checklist?)

logic:
    modules for:
        create new to-do
        set to-do as complete
        change to-do priority
        dom stuff

interface: 
    view the different categories of to-dos and select one / default/all is selected initially
    view the to-do's from all lists (due date (rag rated?), title)
    expand a to-do to see / edit the details
    delete a to-do

inspo:
    Todoist
    Things
    any.do

webpack:
    date-fns (can format & manipulate dates/times)

web storage API:
    
    localstorage docs
    data is sent/received in json format
    can't store functions in json
    (Keep in mind you cannot store functions in JSON, so youâ€™ll have to figure out how to add methods back to your object properties once you fetch them. Good luck!)
    
    functions:
        to save projects/to-dos to localstorage every time one is created
        check for localstorage data when app is first loaded
        if localstorage doesn't exist - create it
